## Skills to practice

- Working with Jest
- Writing clear and polyvalent tests
- Getting familiar with TDD workflow (write a simple test, write just enough code to make it pass, if it fails change code, until it passes. Write another test ... and so on)
- Organizing code into modules

## Assignment

Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass by writing code :

- A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

- A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

- A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

- A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”. 
  
- An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.

## Test

- Launch Jest in the terminal and see if the tests pass
